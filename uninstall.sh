unbreak uninstaller (for users who installed without Homebrew).

  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bart-turczynski/unbreak/main/uninstall.sh | bash

Tears down unbreak state (login watcher, logs, undo socket, config) and removes the
`unbreak` binary. Homebrew users: run `brew uninstall unbreak` instead.

Options:
  --keep-config    leave the config file in place
  -h, --help       show this help

Env overrides:
  UNBREAK_PREFIX     install prefix to look under (default: search the usual paths)
