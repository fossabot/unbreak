/// The `ccfix undo` subcommand (PRD v2 §7.1).
///
/// Sits *in front of* the one-shot `CLI` grammar — like the setup-family verbs in
/// `SetupCommand` — so `ccfix undo` is never read as "repair the literal text
/// `undo`". `parse` returns `nil` for anything that is not `undo`, letting the
/// executable fall through to `CLI.parse`.
///
/// The command is a thin client: it asks the running daemon (over the undo socket)
/// to restore the pre-fix clipboard and reports the daemon's answer. The restore
/// itself happens daemon-side (see `RollbackService`), so this process never
/// touches the clipboard — which is why the work is injected as a `requestUndo`
/// closure and the whole run driver is unit-testable without a socket.
